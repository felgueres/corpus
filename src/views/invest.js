        Lower the barrier of investment on sustainable infrastructure.
    We are betting on long term investments to curb climate change against short-term high gains.
    1. Climate change risks and opportunities are not priced in the valuation of companies.
    2. Inflation is a thing. Investing in assets is important to preserve wealth.
    3. Climate finance requires huge capital (~ 1 trillion USD / year). 
    4. Climate markets require development. How can we aggregate and securitize small projects?
    5. Crypto wants yield!
    6. Climate investment is particularly well suited for stable yield once assets are out of development phase.
    7. World Bank is a phenomenal business model. Democratize that model.
    8. belief: only companies with a net zero strategy in place will have access to capital.
    9. belief: companies with a net zero strategy will experience growth. 
    10. belief: crypto provides liquidity for developing projects at risk, after risk and high returns, assets are offloaded to low risk entitites.
